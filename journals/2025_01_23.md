		  They mention about transactional and non transactional databases:
		  'Transactional databases mean read and write data quickly while maintaining integrity of the data'
		  
		  The distinction between SQL being transactional and NoSQL databases not being transactional lies in 
		  how these databases handle transactions and adhere to the principles of ACID properties (Atomicity,
		  Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
		  
		  1. SQL Databases
		  Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are traditionally designed to be ACID compliant,
		  meaning they support transactions in a robust way.
		  
		  'ACID Explained:'
		  - Atomicity:
		  	- Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none of them are applied
		      - Example : Transferring money between account, either both the debit and credit operations succeed or neither happens
		  - Consistency:
		  	- Ensures that the database moves from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity
		      - Example: If a transaction violates key constraint, it is rolled back
		  - Isolation:
		  	- Ensure
