		  They mention about transactional and non transactional databases:
		  'Transactional databases mean read and write data quickly while maintaining integrity of the data'
		  
		  The distinction between SQL being transactional and NoSQL databases not being transactional lies in 
		  how these databases handle transactions and adhere to the principles of ACID properties (Atomicity,
		  Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
		  
		  1. SQL Databases
		  Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are traditionally designed to be ACID compliant,
		  meaning they support transactions in a robust way.
		  
		  'ACID Explained:'
		  - Atomicity:
		  	- Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed successfully or none of them are applied
		      - Example : Transferring money between account, either both the debit and credit operations succeed or neither happens
		  - Consistency:
		  	- Ensures that the database moves from one valid state to another, maintaining data integrity
		      - Example: If a transaction violates key constraint, it is rolled back
		  - Isolation:
		  	- Ensure that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
		      - Example: A ttrabsaction in progress wont be visible to others until its committed
		  - Durability:
		  	- Oncne a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even if a crash occurs.
		      - Example: After a successful order placement, the record remains intact despite server failure.
		  
		  'Why SQL Database are Transactional:'
		  - SQL databases are designed for applications where strong consistency and reliability are critical
		  (e.g., banking system, inventory management)
		  - To achieve this by:
		  	- Locking mechanisms
		      - Rollbacks and commits
		      - Journaling or write-ahead logging
		  
		  2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Transactional or Partial Transactions)
		  NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Cassandra and DynamoDB often priotize availability and scalability over
		  strict adherence to ACID properties. Instead, they are typically BASE-compliant(Basic Availability, Soft State
		  , Eventual Consistency)
		  
		  'BASE Explained:'
		  1. Basic Availability
		  	- The database quarantees availability even under partial failures
		      - Example: A query might return a partial result instead of failing entirely
		  2. Soft State
		  	- The state of the database may change over time due to eventual consistency
		  3. Eventual Consistency
		  	- Updates propogate across the system, and eventually, all nodes converge to the same state
		      - Example: In distributed systems, if a record is updated in one data center, other replicas
		     	  may take time to reflect the change.
		  
		  'Why NoSQL Is Not Fully Transactional:'
		  - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal
