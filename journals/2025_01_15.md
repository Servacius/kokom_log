	- Topic : Floating-Point Numbers Aren't Real
		- ```apl
		  Floating-Point Numbers are not "Real Numbers" in the mathematical sense, even though they
		  are called real in some programming languages, such as Pascal and Fortran.
		  Real numbers have infinite precision and are therefore continuous and nonlossy; floating-point numbers have limited precision,
		  so they are finite, and they resemble “badly behaved” integers, because they’re
		  not evenly spaced throughout their range.
		  
		  To illustrate, assign 2147483647 (the largest signed 32-bit integer) to a 32-bit
		  float variable (x, say), and print it. You’ll see 2147483648. Now print x-64. Still
		  2147483648. Now print x-65, and you’ll get 2147483520! Why? Because the
		  spacing between adjacent floats in that range is 128, and floating-point operations 
		  round to the nearest floating-point number.
