	- Topic : Floating-Point Numbers Aren't Real
		- ```apl
		  Floating-Point Numbers are not "Real Numbers" in the mathematical sense, even though they
		  are called real in some programming languages, such as Pascal and Fortran.
		  Real numbers have infinite precision and are therefore continuous and nonlossy; floating-point numbers have limited precision,
		  so they are finite, and they resemble “badly behaved” integers, because they’re
		  not evenly spaced throughout their range.
		  
		  To illustrate, assign 2147483647 (the largest signed 32-bit integer) to a 32-bit
		  float variable (x, say), and print it. You’ll see 2147483648. Now print x-64. Still
		  2147483648. Now print x-65, and you’ll get 2147483520! Why? Because the
		  spacing between adjacent floats in that range is 128, and floating-point operations 
		  round to the nearest floating-point number.
		  
		  It should go without saying that you shouldn’t use floating-point numbers for
		  financial applications—that’s what decimal classes in languages like Python
		  and 'C#' are for. Floating-point numbers are intended for efficient scientific
		  computation. But efficiency is worthless without accuracy, so remember the
		  source of rounding errors, and code accordingly!

	- Fulfill Your Ambitions with Open Source
		- ```apl
		  Chances are pretty good that you are not developing software at work that fulfill 
		  most ambitious software development daydreams.Perhaps
		  you are developing software for a huge insurance company when you would
		  rather be working at Google, Apple, Microsoft, or your own startup developing
		  the next big thing. You’ll never get where you want to go developing software for
		  systems you don’t care about.
		  
		  Fortunately, there is an answer to your problem: open source. There are thousands 
		  of open source projects out there, many of them quite active, which offer
		  you any kind of software development experience you could want. If you love
		  the idea of developing operating systems, go help with one of the dozen operating 
		  system projects. If you want to work on music software, animation software, cryptography, robotics, PC games, massive online player games, mobile
		  phones, or whatever, you’ll almost certainly find at least one open source project 
		  dedicated to that interest.
