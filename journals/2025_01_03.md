	- Topic : Comments is What the Code Cannot Say
		- ```apl
		  In practice, however, comments often become a blight.
		  As with any other form of writing, there is a skill to writing good comments.
		  Much of the skill is in knowing when not to write them.
		  Each comment should add some value for the reader, otherwise
		  it is waste that should be removed or rewritten.
