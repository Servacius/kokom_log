	- Topic : Comments is What the Code Cannot Say
		- ```apl
		  In practice, however, comments often become a blight.
		  As with any other form of writing, there is a skill to writing good comments.
		  Much of the skill is in knowing when not to write them.
		  Each comment should add some value for the reader, otherwise
		  it is waste that should be removed or rewritten.
		  What then qualifies as value? Comments should say something code does not
		  and cannot say. A comment explaining what a piece of code should already
		  say is an invitation to change code structure or coding conventions so the code
		  speaks for itself. Instead of compensating for poor method or class names,
		  rename them. Instead of commenting sections in long functions, extract
		  smaller functions whose names capture the former sections’ intent. Try to
		  express as much as possible through code. Any shortfall between what you
		  can express in code and what you would like to express in total becomes a
		  plausible candidate for a useful comment. 'Comment what the code cannot say,'
		  'not simply what it does not say'.

	- Topic : Continuous Learning
		- ```apl
		  As development gets distributed across the globe, you learn there are lots 
		  of people capable of doing your job. You need to keep learning to stay 
		  marketable. Otherwise you’ll become a dinosaur, stuck in the same job until, 
		  one day, you’ll no longer be needed or your job gets 
		  outsourced to some cheaper resource.
		  Here’s a list of ways to keep you learning :
		  • Read books, magazines, blogs, Twitter feeds, and websites. If you want
		  to go deeper into a subject, consider joining a mailing list or newsgroup.
		  • If you really want to get immersed in a technology, get hands on—write
		  some code.
		  • Always try to work with a mentor, as being the top guy can hinder your
		  education. Although you can learn something from anybody, you can
		  learn a whole lot more from someone smarter or more experienced than
		  you
