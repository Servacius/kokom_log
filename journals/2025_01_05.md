	- Topic : Deploy and Often
		- ```apl
		  Reviews and demonstrations are done from a hand-crafted environment
		  to ensure that everything works. The result is that the team gets no experience
		  with the deployment process or the deployed environment until it may be too
		  late to make changes.
		  Running and testing the installation process on a clean environment periodically
		  also provides a check that you have not made assumptions in the code
		  that rely on the development or test environments.
		  While “being able to deploy” doesn’t seem to have a lot of business value
		  early on as compared to seeing an application run on a developer’s laptop,
		  the simple truth is that until you can demonstrate you application on the target environment, there is a lot of work to do before you can deliver business
		  value. If your rationale for putting off a deployment process is that it is trivial,
		  then do it anyway since it is low cost. If it’s too complicated, or if there are too
		  many uncertainties, do what you would do with application code: experiment,
		  evaluate, and refactor the deployment process as you go.
		  The installation/deployment process is essential to the productivity of your
		  customers or your professional services team, so you should be testing and
		  refactoring this process as you go. We test and refactor the source code
		  throughout a project. The deployment deserves no less.
