	- Topic : Don't Touch That Code
		- ```apl
		  Just like developers should have no need to access anything
		  beyond the development server, the QA team and the users have no need to
		  touch anything on the development server. If it’s ready for acceptance testing, 
		  cut a release and roll; don’t ask the user to “just look at something real
		  quick” on the development server. Remember, unless you are coding the project
		  by yourself, other people have code there and they may not be ready for the user
		  to see it. The release manager is the only person who should have access to both.
		  Under no circumstances—ever, at all—should a developer have access to a
		  production server. If there is a problem, your support staff should either fix
		  it or request that you fix it. After it’s checked into SCC, they will roll a patch
		  from there. Some of the biggest programming disasters I’ve been a part of have
		  taken place because someone violated this last rule. If it’s
		  broke, production is not the place to fix it.
