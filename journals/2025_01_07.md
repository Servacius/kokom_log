	- Topic : Do Lots of Deliberate Practice
		- ```apl
		  You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. It’s about
		  skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition. It means performing
		  the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the
		  task. It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again, until you
		  achieve your desired level of mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the
		  task, not to complete the task.
		  
		  'it takes elite performers a minimum of -'
		  '10,000 hours of deliberate focused practice to become experts.'
		  
		  The expertise arrives gradually over time—not all at once in the 10,000th
		  hour! Nevertheless, 10,000 hours is a lot: about 20 hours per week for 10 years.
		  Given this level of commitment, you might be worrying that you’re just not
		  expert material. You are. Greatness is largely a matter of conscious choice.
		  Your choice. Research over the last two decades has shown that the main factor in acquiring expertise is time spent doing deliberate practice. Innate ability
		  is not the main factor. According to Mary Poppendieck:
		  
		  'There is broad consensus among researchers of expert performance that inborn'
		  'talent does not account for much more than a threshold; you have to have a minimum amount'
		  'of natural ability to get started in a sport or profession. After that,'
		  'the people who excel are the ones who work the hardest.'
		  
		  There is little point to deliberately practicing something you are already an
		  expert at. Deliberate practice means practicing something you are not good at.
		  Peter Norvig explains:
		  
		  'The key [to developing expertise] is deliberative practice: not just doing it again'
		  'and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability,' 
		  'trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.'
		  
		  And Mary Poppendieck writes:
		  
		  'Deliberate practice does not mean doing what you are good at; it means challenging yourself,'
		  'doing what you are not good at. So it’s not necessarily fun.'
		  
		  Deliberate practice is about learning—learning that changes you, learning that
		  changes your behavior. Good luck.

	- Topic : Domain-Specific Languages
		- ```apl
		  When ever you listen to a discussion by experts in any domain, be
		  it chess players, kindergarten teachers, or insurance agents, you’ll notice that
		  their vocabulary is quite different from everyday language. That’s part of what
		  domain-specific languages (DSLs) are about: a specific domain has a specialized
		  vocabulary to describe the things that are particular to that domain.
		  
		  In the world of software, DSLs are about executable expressions in a language
		  specific to a domain, employing a limited vocabulary and grammar that is
		  readable, understandable, and—hopefully—writable by domain experts. DSLs
		  targeted at software developers or scientists have been around for a long time.
		  The Unix “little languages” found in configuration files and the languages created 
		  with the power of LISP macros are some of the older examples
		  
		  You have to adapt thetechnical level of the language, the available tools, 
		  syntax help (e.g., IntelliSense),early validation, visualization, and representation to the
		  intended audience.By hiding technical details, DSLs can empower users by giving them the 
		  ability to adapt systems to their needs without requiring the help of developers. It
		  can also speed up development because of the potential distribution of work
		  after the initial language framework is in place. The language can be evolved
		  gradually. There are also different migration paths for existing expressions and
		  grammars available.
