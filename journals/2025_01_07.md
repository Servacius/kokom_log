	- Topic : Do Lots of Deliberate Practice
		- ```apl
		  You do deliberate practice to improve your ability to perform a task. Itâ€™s about
		  skill and technique. Deliberate practice means repetition. It means performing
		  the task with the aim of increasing your mastery of one or more aspects of the
		  task. It means repeating the repetition. Slowly, over and over again, until you
		  achieve your desired level of mastery. You do deliberate practice to master the
		  task, not to complete the task.
		  'it takes elite performers a minimum of -'
		  '10,000 hours of deliberate focused practice to become experts.'
