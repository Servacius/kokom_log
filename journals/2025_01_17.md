	- Topic : The Golden Rule of API Design
		- ```apl
		  API design is tough. If you are designing an API that is going to have hundreds or thousands of users,
		  you have to think about how you might change it in the future and whether your changes might break 
		  client code.
		  
		  Over the past decade, we’ve gradually realized that unit testing is an extremely
		  important part of practice, but that lesson has not completely permeated the
		  industry. The evidence is all around us. Take an arbitrary untested class that
		  uses a third-party API and try to write unit tests for it. Most of the time, you’ll
		  run into trouble. You’ll find that the code using the API is stuck to it like glue.
		  There’s no way to impersonate the API classes so that you can sense your code’s
		  interactions with them, or supply return values for testing.
		  
		  Over time, this will get better, but only if we start to see testing as a real use
		  case when we design APIs. Unfortunately, it’s a little bit more involved than
		  just testing our code. That’s where the Golden Rule of API Design fits in: It’s
		  not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for
		  code that uses your API. When you follow this rule, you learn firsthand the
		  hurdles that your users will have to overcome when they try to test their code
		  independently.
		  
		  There is no one way to make it easy for developers to test code that uses your
		  API. static, final, and sealed are not inherently bad constructs. They can be
		  useful at times. But it is important to be aware of the testing issue and, to do
		  that, you have to experience it yourself. Once you have, you can approach it as
		  you would any other design challenge.

	- Topic : The Guru Myth
		- ```apl
		  Those asking the question rarely bother to include stack traces, error logs, or
		  any context leading to the problem. They seem to think you operate on a different plane, 
		  that solutions appear to you without analysis based on evidence.They think you are a guru.
		  
		  We expect such questions from those unfamiliar with software; to them, systems can seem almost 
		  magical. What worries me is seeing this in the software
		  community. Similar questions arise in program design, such as “I’m building
		  inventory management. Should I use optimistic locking?” Ironically, people
		  asking the question are often better equipped to answer it than the question’s
		  recipient. The questioners presumably know the context, know the requirements, and can 
		  read about the advantages and disadvantages of different strategies. Yet they expect you 
		  to give an intelligent answer without context. They expect magic.
		  
		  It’s time for the software industry to dispel this guru myth. “Gurus” are human.
		  They apply logic and systematically analyze problems like the rest of us. They
		  tap into mental shortcuts and intuition. Consider the best programmer you’ve
		  ever met: at one point, that person knew less about software than you do now.
		  If someone seems like a guru, it’s because of years dedicated to learning and
		  refining thought processes. A “guru” is simply a smart person with relentless
		  curiosity.
		  
		  Finally, one of software’s biggest obstacles is smart people who purposefully
		  propagate the guru myth. This might be done out of ego, or as a strategy to
		  increase one’s value as perceived by a client or employer. Ironically, this attitude can make smart people less valuable, since they don’t contribute to the
		  growth of their peers. We don’t need gurus. We need experts willing to develop
		  other experts in their field. There is room for all of us.

	- Topic : Hard Work Does Not (always) Pay Off by Olve Maudal
		- ```apl
		  As a programmer, youll find that working hard often does not pay off. You might fool yourself and a few
		  colleagues into believing that you are contributing a lot to a project by spending long hours at the office. 
		  But the truth is that by working less, you might achieve more—sometimes much more. If you
		  are trying to be focused and “productive” for more than 30 hours a week, you
		  are probably working too hard. You should consider reducing your workload
		  to become more effective and get more done.
		  
		  This statement may seem counterintuitive and even controversial, but it is a
		  direct consequence of the fact that programming and software development
		  as a whole involve a continuous learning process. As you work on a project,
		  you will understand more of the problem domain and, hopefully, find more
		  effective ways of reaching the goal. To avoid wasted work, you must allow time
		  to observe the effects of what you are doing, reflect on the things that you see,
		  and change your behavior accordingly.
		  
		  Professional programming is usually not like running hard for a few kilometers, 
		  where the goal can be seen at the end of a paved road. Most software
		  projects are more like a long orienteering marathon. In the dark. With only a
		  sketchy map as guidance. If you just set off in one direction, running as fast as
		  you can, you might impress some, but you are not likely to succeed. You need
		  to keep a sustainable pace, and you need to adjust the course when you learn
		  more about where you are and where you are heading.
		  
		  In addition, you always need to learn more about software development in
		  general and programming techniques in particular. You probably need to read
		  books, go to conferences, communicate with other professionals, experiment
		  with new implementation techniques, and learn about powerful tools that simplify your job. 
		  As a professional programmer, you must keep yourself updated
		  in your field of expertise—just as brain surgeons and pilots are expected to
		  keep themselves up to date in their own fields of expertise. You need to spend
		  evenings, weekends, and holidays educating yourself; therefore, you cannot
		  spend your evenings, weekends, and holidays working overtime on your current project. 
		  Do you really expect brain surgeons to perform surgery 60 hours
		  a week, or pilots to fly 60 hours a week? Of course not: preparation and education are an essential part of their profession.
		  
		  Be focused on the project, contribute as much as you can by finding smart
		  solutions, improve your skills, reflect on what you are doing, and adapt yourbehavior. 
		  'Avoid embarrassing yourself, and our profession, by behaving like a hamster in a cage spinning the wheel.'
		  As a professional programmer, you should know that trying to be focused and “productive” 60 hours a week is not
		  a sensible thing to do. Act like a professional: 'prepare, effect, observe, reflect,and change.'
