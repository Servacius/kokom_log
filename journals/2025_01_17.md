	- Topic : The Golden Rule of API Design
		- ```apl
		  API design is tough. If you are designing an API that is going to have hundreds or thousands of users,
		  you have to think about how you might change it in the future and whether your changes might break 
		  client code.
		  
		  Over the past decade, we’ve gradually realized that unit testing is an extremely
		  important part of practice, but that lesson has not completely permeated the
		  industry. The evidence is all around us. Take an arbitrary untested class that
		  uses a third-party API and try to write unit tests for it. Most of the time, you’ll
		  run into trouble. You’ll find that the code using the API is stuck to it like glue.
		  There’s no way to impersonate the API classes so that you can sense your code’s
		  interactions with them, or supply return values for testing.
		  
		  Over time, this will get better, but only if we start to see testing as a real use
		  case when we design APIs. Unfortunately, it’s a little bit more involved than
		  just testing our code. That’s where the Golden Rule of API Design fits in: It’s
		  not enough to write tests for an API you develop; you have to write unit tests for
		  code that uses your API. When you follow this rule, you learn firsthand the
		  hurdles that your users will have to overcome when they try to test their code
		  independently.
		  
		  There is no one way to make it easy for developers to test code that uses your
		  API. static, final, and sealed are not inherently bad constructs. They can be
		  useful at times. But it is important to be aware of the testing issue and, to do
		  that, you have to experience it yourself. Once you have, you can approach it as
		  you would any other design challenge.
