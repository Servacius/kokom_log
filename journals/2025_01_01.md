	- Topic : Code in the Language of the Domain
		- ```apl
		  Making domain concepts explicit in your code means other programmers can
		  gather the intent of the code much more easily than by trying to retrofit an algorithm into what they understand about a domain. It also means that when the
		  domain model evolves—which it will, as your understanding of the domain
		  grows—you are in a good position to evolve the code. Coupled with good encapsulation, the chances are good that the rule will exist in only one place, and that
		  you can change it without any of the dependent code being any the wiser.
		  ```
	- Topic : Code is Design
		- ```apl
		  Great designs are produced by great designers dedicating themselves to
		  the mastery of their craft. Code is no different.
