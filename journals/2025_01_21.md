	  It contains some summary from book A Philosophy of Software Design.
	  
	  'On Coding Advice'
	  Understand why you disagree about someone coding advice, try to understand yours first
	  -Every rule has its exceptions, and every principle has its limits,  
	  If you take any design idea to its extreme, you’ll probably end up in a bad place-
	  
	  'Complexity'
	  Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems 
	  simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex. When you find yourself 
	  in situations like this, it’s worth probing other developers to find out why the code seems complex 
	  to them; there are probably some interesting lessons to learn from the disconnect between your 
	  opinion and theirs. Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily,
	  but to create code that others can also work with easily.
	  -Good design should be obvious.-
	  
	  'Modules, interfaces, and implementations'
	  Modules should be deep. Complex implementations should be hidden behind simple interfaces with 
	  sensible defaults that work for the most common use cases.
	  -The best features are the ones you get without even knowing they exist-
	  -As a module developer, you should strive to make lige as easy as possible for the users of your module
	  , even if it means extra work for you-
	  -Reduce the number of places where exceptions must be handled-
