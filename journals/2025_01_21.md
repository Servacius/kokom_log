	  It contains some summary from book A Philosophy of Software Design.
	  
	  'On Coding Advice'
	  Understand why you disagree about someone coding advice, try to understand yours first
	  -Every rule has its exceptions, and every principle has its limits,  
	  If you take any design idea to its extreme, you’ll probably end up in a bad place-
	  
	  'Complexity'
	  Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems 
	  simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex. When you find yourself 
	  in situations like this, it’s worth probing other developers to find out why the code seems complex 
	  to them; there are probably some interesting lessons to learn from the disconnect between your 
	  opinion and theirs. Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily,
	  but to create code that others can also work with easily.
	  -Good design should be obvious.-
	  
	  'Modules, interfaces, and implementations'
	  Modules should be deep. Complex implementations should be hidden behind simple interfaces with 
	  sensible defaults that work for the most common use cases.
	  -The best features are the ones you get without even knowing they exist-
	  -As a module developer, you should strive to make lige as easy as possible for the users of your module
	  , even if it means extra work for you-
	  -Reduce the number of places where exceptions must be handled-
	  
	  'Design approaches'
	  Designing software is hard, so it’s unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or 
	  system will produce the best design. You’ll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple 
	  options for each major design decision.
	  Try to pick approaches that are radically different from each other; you’ll learn more that way. 
	  Even if you are certain that there is only one reasonable approach, consider a second design 
	  anyway, no matter how bad you think it will be. It will be instructive to think about 
	  the weaknesses of that design and contrast them with the features of other designs.
	  
	  'Comments and documentation'
	  Comments should be used to explain things that cant be expressed in code, like the rationale for 
	  why a certain decision was made.
	  The biggest challenge with cross-module documentation is finding a place to put it
	  where it will naturally be discovered by developers.
	  
	  'Consistency, conventions, and coding styles'
	  Consistenncy creates cognitive leverage: once you have learned how something is done in one place
	  you can use that knowledge to immediately understand other places that use that same approach.
	  Document coding conventions and coding style preferences. Automate and enforce what you can ,
	  like with ESLint and Prettier. When joining a new company or team, stick to existing conventions
	  that are already in place. Refactoring or re-writing all the code to use a new convention is rarely
	  worth it
	  
	  'Tactical vs strategic programming'
	  Tactical vs. strategic programming. Don’t just focus on getting a small change working if it makes 
	  future changes more difficult.
	  
	  -One of the risks of agile development is that it can lead to tactical programming. 
	  Agile development tends to focus developers on features, not abstractions, and it encourages 
	  developers to put off design decisions in order to produce working software as soon as possible. 
	  For example, some agile practitioners argue that you shouldn’t implement general-purpose 
	  mechanisms right away; implement a minimal special-purpose mechanism to start with, and refactor 
	  into something more generic later, once you know that it’s needed. Although these arguments 
	  make sense to a degree, they are against an investment approach, and they encourage a more 
	  tactical style of programming. This can result in rapid accumulation of complexity.-
	  
	  'Importance of tests'
	  With a good set of tests, developers can be more confident when refactoring because the test suite
	  will find most bugs that are introduced. This encourages developers to make structural improvements
	  to a system, which results in a better design. Unit tests are particularly valuable: they provide
	  a higher degree of code coverage that system tests, so they are more likely to uncover any bugs.
	  
	  'Performance improvements'
	  Before making performance changes, measure what you need in order to create benchmarks for 
	  the existing performance. Our intuitions of what changes will improve performance are sometimes 
	  wrong, having either no meaningful impact or actually making performance worse.
	  Design code around the critical path. 'Performance improvements in other places that are not the'
	  'biggest bottleneck will still result in a bottleneck when you hit that part of the path.'
	  
	  'Conclusion'
	  -The investments you make in good design will pay off quickly. The modules you defined carefully
	  at the beginning
