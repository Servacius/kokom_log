	  It contains some summary from book A Philosophy of Software Design.
	  
	  'On Coding Advice'
	  Understand why you disagree about someone coding advice, try to understand yours first
	  -Every rule has its exceptions, and every principle has its limits,  
	  If you take any design idea to its extreme, you’ll probably end up in a bad place-
	  
	  'Complexity'
	  Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers. If you write a piece of code and it seems 
	  simple to you, but other people think it is complex, then it is complex. When you find yourself 
	  in situations like this, it’s worth probing other developers to find out why the code seems complex 
	  to them; there are probably some interesting lessons to learn from the disconnect between your 
	  opinion and theirs. Your job as a developer is not just to create code that you can work with easily,
	  but to create code that others can also work with easily.
	  -Good design should be obvious.-
	  
	  'Modules, interfaces, and implementations'
	  Modules should be deep. Complex implementations should be hidden behind simple interfaces with 
	  sensible defaults that work for the most common use cases.
	  -The best features are the ones you get without even knowing they exist-
	  -As a module developer, you should strive to make lige as easy as possible for the users of your module
	  , even if it means extra work for you-
	  -Reduce the number of places where exceptions must be handled-
	  
	  'Design approaches'
	  Designing software is hard, so it’s unlikely that your first thoughts about how to structure a module or 
	  system will produce the best design. You’ll end up with a much better result if you consider multiple 
	  options for each major design decision.
	  Try to pick approaches that are radically different from each other; you’ll learn more that way. 
	  Even if you are certain that there is only one reasonable approach, consider a second design 
	  anyway, no matter how bad you think it will be. It will be instructive to think about 
	  the weaknesses of that design and contrast them with the features of other designs.
	  
	  'Comments and documentation'
	  Comments should be used to explain things that cant be expressed in code, like the rationale for 
	  why a certain decision was made.
	  The biggest challenge with cross-module documentation is finding a place to put it
	  where it will naturally be discovered by developers.
	  
	  'Consistency, conventions, and coding styles'
	  Consistenncy creates cognitive leverage: once you have learned how something is done in one place
	  you can use that knowledge to immediately understand other places that use that same approach.
	  Document coding conventions and coding style preferences. Automate and enforce what you can ,
	  like with ESLint and Prettier. When joining a new company or team, stick to existing conventions
	  that are already in place. Refactoring or re-writing all the code to use a new convention is rarely
	  worth it
	  
	  'Tactical vs strategic programming'
