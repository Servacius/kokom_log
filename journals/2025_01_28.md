		- ```apl
		  Programmers should always be interested in learning
		  new languages, preferably from an unfamiliar paradigm. Even if their day job
		  always uses the same programming language, the increased sophistication of
		  use of that language when a person can cross-fertilize from other paradigms
		  should not be underestimated. Employers should take this into account and
		  allow room in their training budget for employees to learn languages that
		  are not currently being used, as a way of increasing the sophistication of the
		  languages that are being used.
		  Although itâ€™s a start, a one-week training course is not sufficient to learn a new
		  language: it generally takes a good few months of use, even if part-time, to gain
		  a proper working knowledge of a language. It is the idioms of use, not just the
		  syntax and computational model, that are the important factors.
