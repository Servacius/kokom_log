		- ```apl
		  Know your next commit. If you cannot finish, throw away your changes, then
		  define a new task you believe in with the insights you have gained. 
		  Do speculative experimentation whenever needed, but do not let yourself 
		  slip into speculative mode without noticing. Do not commit guesswork into your repository.
