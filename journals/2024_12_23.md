		  Users tend to muddle through. They’ll find a way that works and stick with
		  it, no matter how convoluted. It’s better to provide one really obvious way of
		  doing things than two or three shortcuts.
		  
		  You’ll also find that there’s a gap between what users say they want and what
		  they actually do. That’s worrying, as the normal way of gathering user requirements is to ask them. It’s why the best way to capture requirements is to watch
		  users. Spending an hour watching users is more informative than spending a
		  day guessing what they want.

		  One reason to format the code in a uniform way is so that nobody 
		  can "own" a piece of code just by formatting it in his or her private way.
		  We may want to prevent developers from using certain antipatterns in order 
		  to avoid some common bugs. 
		  
		  In all, a coding standard should make it easier towork in the project, 
		  and maintain development speed from the beginning to the end.

		  The bottom line is that beautiful code is simple code. Each individual part
		  is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple relationships with the
		  other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time, with clean, simple, testable code, ensuring a high speed of
		  development throughout the lifetime of the system.
		  Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.

		  1. The best approach for restructuring starts by taking stock of the existing
		  codebase and the tests written against that code.
		  
		  2. Avoid the temptation to rewrite everything. It is best to reuse as much
		  code as possible. No matter how ugly the code is, it has already been
		  tested, reviewed, etc. And it save times.
		  
		  3. Many incremental changes are better than one massive change. Incremental changes allows you to gauge the impact on the system more easily
		  through feedback, such as from tests. It is no fun to see a hundred test
		  failures after you make a change. This can lead to frustration and pressure
		  that can in turn result in bad decisions.
		  
		  4. After each development iteration, it is important to ensure that the existing
		  tests pass. Add new tests if the existing tests are not sufficient to cover the
		  changes you made. Do not throw away the tests from the old code without due consideration. 
		  On the surface, some of these tests may not appear
		  to be applicable to your new design, but it would be well worth the effort
		  to dig deep down into the reasons why this particular test was added.
		  
		  5. Personal preferences and ego shouldn’t get in the way. If something isn’t
		  broken, why fix it? That the style or the structure of the code does not
		  meet your personal preference is not a valid reason for restructuring.
		  Thinking you could do a better job than the previous programmer is not
		  a valid reason, either. 
		  
		  6. New technology is an insufficient reason to refactor. One of the worst reasons
		  to refactor is because the current code is way behind all the cool technology we have today, 
		  and we believe that a new language or framework can
		  do things a lot more elegantly. Unless a cost-benefit analysis shows that
		  a new language or framework will result in significant improvements in
		  functionality, maintainability, or productivity, it is best to leave it as it is. 
		  
		  7. Remember that humans make mistakes. Restructuring will not always
		  guarantee that the new code will be better—or even as good as—the previous attempt.
