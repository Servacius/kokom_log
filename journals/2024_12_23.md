		  Users tend to muddle through. They’ll find a way that works and stick with
		  it, no matter how convoluted. It’s better to provide one really obvious way of

		  they actually do. That’s worrying, as the normal way of gathering user requirements is to ask them. It’s why the best way to capture requirements is to watch
		  users. Spending an hour watching users is more informative than spending a
		  day guessing what they want.
