		  Users tend to muddle through. They’ll find a way that works and stick with
		  it, no matter how convoluted. It’s better to provide one really obvious way of
		  doing things than two or three shortcuts.
		  
		  You’ll also find that there’s a gap between what users say they want and what
		  they actually do. That’s worrying, as the normal way of gathering user requirements is to ask them. It’s why the best way to capture requirements is to watch
		  users. Spending an hour watching users is more informative than spending a
		  day guessing what they want.

		  One reason to format the code in a uniform way is so that nobody 
		  can "own" a piece of code just by formatting it in his or her private way.
		  We may want to prevent developers from using certain antipatterns in order 
		  to avoid some common bugs. 
		  
		  In all, a coding standard should make it easier towork in the project, 
		  and maintain development speed from the beginning to the end.

		  The bottom line is that beautiful code is simple code. Each individual part
		  is kept simple with simple responsibilities and simple relationships with the
		  other parts of the system. This is the way we can keep our systems maintainable over time, with clean, simple, testable code, ensuring a high speed of
		  development throughout the lifetime of the system.
		  Beauty is born of and found in simplicity.

		  1. The best approach for restructuring starts by taking stock of the existing
		  codebase and the tests written against that code.
		  
		  2. Avoid the temptation to rewrite everything. It is best to reuse as much
		  code as possible. No matter how ugly the code is, it has already been
		  tested, reviewed, etc. And it save times.
		  
		  3. Many incremental changes are better than one massive change. Incremental changes allows you to gauge the impact on the system more easily
		  through feedback, such as from tests. It is no fun to see a hundred test
		  failures after you make a change. This can lead to frustration and pressure
		  that can in turn result in bad decisions.
