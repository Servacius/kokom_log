	- Topic : Code Reviews
		- ```apl
		  Making code reviews fun is perhaps the most important contributor to success. Reviews are about the people reviewing. If the review meeting is painful
		  or dull, it will be hard to motivate anyone. Make it an informal code review
		  whose principal purpose is to share knowledge among team members. Leave
		  sarcastic comments outside, and bring a cake or brown-bag lunch instead.
