	- Topic : Code Reviews
		- ```apl
		  Making code reviews fun is perhaps the most important contributor to success. Reviews are about the people reviewing. If the review meeting is painful
		  or dull, it will be hard to motivate anyone. Make it an informal code review
		  whose principal purpose is to share knowledge among team members. Leave
		  sarcastic comments outside, and bring a cake or brown-bag lunch instead.
		  ```
	- Topic : Coding with Reason
	- Topic : A Commment on Comments
		- ```apl
		  Sprinkle your code with relevant comments explaining what the code is supposed to accomplish. 
		  But not always imbue the comment, because if your function or variable naming
		  is enought to describe the purpose of the code, thats enough.
		  Your header comments should give any programmer enough information to
		  use your code without having to read it, while your inline comments should
		  assist the next developer in fixing or extending it.
