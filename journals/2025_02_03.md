	- Topic : The Longetivity of Interim Solutions
		- ```apl
		  You will create many solutions; some of them will be interim, most of them will
		  be useful. The best way to overcome interim solutions is to make them superfluous, 
		  to provide a more elegant and useful solution. May you be granted the
		  serenity to accept the things you cannot change, the courage to change the
		  things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference

	- Topic : Put Everything Under Version Control
		- ```apl
		  Once you’ve seen the beauty of working with a version control system, following 
		  a couple of rules will make you and your team even more effective:
		  
		  • Commit each logical change in a separate operation. Lumping many changes
		  together in a single commit will make it difficult to disentangle them in the
		  feature. This is especially important when you make project-wide refactorings or style changes,
		  which can easily obscure other modifications.
		  
		  • Accompany each commit with an explanatory message. At a minimum,
		  describe succinctly what you’ve changed, but if you also want to record
		  the change’s rationale, this is the best place to store it.
		  
		  • Finally, avoid committing code that will break a project’s build, otherwise
		  you’ll become unpopular with the project’s other developers.
		  
		  Life under a version control system is too good to ruin it with easily avoidable
		  missteps.

- Topic : Put the Mouse Down and Step Away from the Keyboard
	- ```apl
	  So you get up to stretch your legs or to hit the vending
	  machines and, on the way back, the answer suddenly becomes obvious.
	  The point is that until I got away from the computer, I thought
	  my first attempt was the best solution to the problem.
	  So, the next time you hit a nasty problem, do yourself a favor. Once you really
	  understand the problem, go do something involving the creative side of your
	  brain—sketch out the problem, listen to some music, or just take a walk outside. 
	  Sometimes the best thing you can do to solve a problem is to put the
	  mouse down and step away from the keyboard.
