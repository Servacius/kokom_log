	- Topic : Don't Be Afraid to Break Things
		- ```apl
		  Like surgeon who isn’t afraid to cut out the sick parts to make room for healing. 
		  The attitude is contagious and will inspire others to start working on those
		  cleanup projects they’ve been putting off. Keep a “hygiene” list of tasks that the
		  team feels are worthwhile for the general good of the project. Convince management 
		  that even though these tasks may not produce visible results, they
		  will reduce expenses and expedite future releases. Never stop caring about the
		  general “health” of the code.
		  ```
	- Topic : Don't be Cute with Your Test Data
		- ```apl
		  When writing any text in your code—whether comments, logging, dialogs, or 
		  test data—always ask yourself how it will look if it becomes
		  public. It will save some red faces all around.
		  ```
	- Topic : Don't ignore That Error!
		- ```apl
		  Error, what error? It won’t be serious. Honestly. I can ignore it. 
		  This is not a winning strategy for solid code. In fact, it’s just plain laziness. (The wrong sort.)
		  No matter how unlikely you think an error is in your code, you should always
		  check for it, and always handle it. Every time. You’re not saving time if you
		  don’t; you’re storing up potential problems for the future.
		  If you ignore an error, turn a blind eye, and pretend that nothing has gone wrong,
		  you run great risks.
		  
		  Not handling errors leads to:
		  • Brittle code. Code that’s filled with exciting, hard-to-find bugs.
		  • Insecure code. Crackers often exploit poor error handling to break into
		  software systems.
		  • Poor structure. If there are errors from your code that are tedious to deal
		  with continually, you probably have a poor interface. Express it so that
		  the errors are less intrusive and their handling is less onerous. 
		  ```
	- Topic : Don't Just Learn the Language, Understand Its Culture
		- ```apl
		  Code is in many ways similar. If you write Wakese code with a little Python,
		  some Java, and a hint of Erlang, your projects will be a mess. If you instead
		  explore new languages to expand your mind and get fresh ideas on how you
		  can solve things in different ways, you will find that the code you write in your
		  trusty old language gets more beautiful for every new language you’ve learned.
		  For example, You’ll also get a better understanding of design patterns by moving between
		  different languages. C programmers find that C# and Java have commoditized
		  the iterator pattern. In Ruby and other dynamic languages, you might still use
		  a visitor, but your implementation won’t look like the example from the Gang
		  of Four book.
