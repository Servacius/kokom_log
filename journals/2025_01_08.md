		- ```apl
		  Like surgeon who isn’t afraid to cut out the sick parts to make room for healing. 
		  The attitude is contagious and will inspire others to start working on those
		  cleanup projects they’ve been putting off. Keep a “hygiene” list of tasks that the
		  team feels are worthwhile for the general good of the project. Convince management 
		  that even though these tasks may not produce visible results, they
		  will reduce expenses and expedite future releases. Never stop caring about the
		  general “health” of the code.
