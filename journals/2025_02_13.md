	  When and where to use indexing db:
	  1. Frequent Search Queries
	  	- Use indexing when you frequently search for specific rows using 'WHERE', 'JOIN', or 'ORDER BY' clauses.
	      - Example: Searching for a user by 'email' or 'username'.
	  2. Large Tables
	  	- Indexing is benefical for large tables where full table scans would be slow
	      - Example : A table with millions of rows
	  3. Columns with High Selectivity
	  	- Use indexing on columns with high selectivity (columns with many unique values)
	      - Example : Primary keys, unique identifiers or columns with distinct values.
	  4. Foreign Keys:
	  	- Index foreign key columns to speed up 'JOIN' operations and enforce referential integrity.
	      - Example : A 'user_id' column in an 'orders' table.
	  5. Sorting and Grouping
	  	- Use indexing on column used in 'OORDER BY' or 'GROUP BY' clauses to speed up sorting and grouping operations.
	      - Example : Sorting products by 'price' or grouping sales by 'region'.
	  6. Composite Queries
	  	- Use composite indexes (indexes on multiple columns) for queries that filter or sort on multiple columns.
	      - Example : Filtering by 'category' and sorting by 'price'.
	  7. Read-Heavy Workloads
	  	- Indexing is ideal for read-heavy databases where queries are more frequent than writes.
	      
	  When not to use Indexing
	  1. Small Tables
	  	- Avoid indexing small tables because the overhead of maintaining the index may outweight the benefits.
	      - Example : A table with fewer than 100 rows.
	  2. Columns with Low Selectivity:
	  	- Avoid indexing columns with low selectivity (columns with few unique values, like gender or status).
	  	- Example: A status column with only two values: active and inactive.
	  3. Write-Heavy Workloads:
	  	- Avoid excessive indexing in write-heavy databases because every INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation requires updating the index, which can slow down performance.
	  	- Example: A logging table with frequent writes.
	  4. Columns Rarely Used in Queries:
	  	- Do not index columns that are rarely used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses.
	  	- Example: A description column that is only used for display purposes.
	  5. Frequently Updated Columns:
	  	- Avoid indexing columns that are frequently updated, as this requires constant index maintenance.
	  	- Example: A last_login column that is updated every time a user logs in.
	  6. High Cardinality Columns:
	  	- Be cautious with indexing high-cardinality columns (e.g., BLOB or TEXT), as they can lead to large indexes.
	  	- Example: A comments column storing large text data.
	  7. Over-Indexing:
	  	- Avoid creating too many indexes on a single table, as this can slow down write operations and consume additional storage.
	  	- Example: Creating separate indexes for every column in a table.
	      
	  Trade-offs of Indexing
	  Pros:
	  - Speeds up read operations (queries).
	  - Improves performance for filtering, sorting, and joining.
	  Cons:
	  - Slows down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
	  - Consumes additional storage space.
	  - Requires maintenance (e.g., rebuilding indexes after large data changes).
