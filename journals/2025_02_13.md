	- ```apl
	  When and where to use indexing db:
	  1. Frequent Search Queries
	  	- Use indexing when you frequently search for specific rows using 'WHERE', 'JOIN', or 'ORDER BY' clauses.
	      - Example: Searching for a user by 'email' or 'username'.
	  2. Large Tables
	  	- Indexing is benefical for large tables where full table scans would be slow
	      - Example : A table with millions of rows
	  3. Columns with High Selectivity
	  	- Use indexing on columns with high selectivity (columns with many unique values)
	      - Example : Primary keys, unique identifiers or columns with distinct values.
	  4. Foreign Keys:
	  	- Index foreign key columns to speed up 'JOIN' operations and enforce referential integrity.
	      - Example : A 'user_id' column in an 'orders' table.
	  5. Sorting and Grouping
	  	- Use indexing on column used in 'OORDER BY' or 'GROUP BY' clauses to speed up sorting and grouping operations.
	      - Example : Sorting products by 'price' or grouping sales by 'region'.
	  6. Composite Queries
	  	- Use composite indexes (indexes on multiple columns) for queries that filter or sort on multiple columns.
	      - Example : Filtering by 'category' and sorting by 'price'.
	  7. Read-Heavy Workloads
	  	- Indexing is ideal for read-heavy databases where queries are more frequent than writes.
	      
	  When not to use Indexing
	  1. Small Tables
	  	- Avoid indexing small tables because the overhead of maintaining the index may outweight the benefits.
	      - Example : A table with fewer than 100 rows.
	  2. Columns
