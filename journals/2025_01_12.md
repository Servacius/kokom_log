		  "You don’t have to understand all the magic that makes your project work,
		  'but it doesn’t hurt to understand some of it—or to appreciate someone who
		  'understands the bits you don’t.
		  
		  Most importantly, make sure that when the magic stops, it can be started again.

	- Topic : Don't Repeat Yourself
		- ```apl
		  DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) is perhaps one of the most fundamental. The principle was formulated 
		  by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in The Pragmatic Programmer, and underlies 
		  many other wellknown software development best practices and design patterns.
		  
		  'Duplication Is Waste'
		  The bloat that duplication adds to the system also makes it more
		  difficult for developers working with the system to fully understand the entire
		  system, or to be certain that changes made in one location do not also need
		  to be made in other places that duplicate the logic they are working on. DRY
		  requires that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,
		  authoritative representation within a system.”
		  
		  'Repetition in Process Calls for Automation
		  Many processes in software development are repetitive and easily automated.
		  The DRY principle applies in these contexts, as well as in the source code of
		  the application. Manual testing is slow, error-prone, and difficult to repeat,
		  so automated test suites should be used where possible. Integrating software
		  can be time consuming and error-prone if done manually, so a build process
		  should be run as frequently as possible, ideally with every check-in. Wherever
		  painful manual processes exist that can be automated, they should be automated and standardized. The goal is to ensure that there is only one way of
		  accomplishing the task, and it is as painless as possible.
		  
		  'Repetition in Logic Calls for Abstraction
		  Repetition in logic can take many forms. Copy-and-paste if-then or switchcase logic is among the easiest to detect and correct. Many design patterns
		  have the explicit goal of reducing or eliminating duplication in logic within
		  an application. If an object typically requires several things to happen before
		  it can be used, this can be accomplished with an Abstract Factory or a Factory
		  Method pattern. If an object has many possible variations in its behavior, these
		  behaviors can be injected using the Strategy pattern rather than large if-then
		  structures. In fact, the formulation of design patterns themselves is an attempt
		  to reduce the duplication of effort required to solve common problems and
		  discuss such solutions. In addition, DRY can be applied to structures, such as
		  database schema, resulting in normalization.
