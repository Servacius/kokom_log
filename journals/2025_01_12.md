		  'but it doesn’t hurt to understand some of it—or to appreciate someone who

	- Topic : Don't Repeat Yourself
		- ```apl
		  DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) is perhaps one of the most fundamental. The principle was formulated 
		  by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in The Pragmatic Programmer, and underlies

		  difficult for developers working with the system to fully understand the entire
		  system, or to be certain that changes made in one location do not also need

		  authoritative representation within a system.”
